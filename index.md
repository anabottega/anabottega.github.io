  <p> Hi, I’m Ana Bottega! I'm a public economist specializing in tax policy.</p>
  <p> I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of São Paulo (USP). During my PhD, I have undertaken short research visits at Princeton and Cambridge, and was a visiting researcher at the Department of Economics at UC Berkeley for the 2024–2025 academic year.</p>
  <p>I currently work as a consultant to the IDB/BR fiscal team and the UNDP/NY gender team. My (extensive) experience with international organizations on tax policy includes serving as advisor to the international taxation agenda of the G20 Presidency at Brazil’s Federal Ministry of Finance in 2024.</p>
