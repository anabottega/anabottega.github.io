I'm an Econ PhD Candidate at the University of São Paulo (USP). I visited the Industrial Relations Section at Princeton University from February to March 2023 and the Center of Latin American Studies of Cambridge University from April to June 2023. I'll be visiting UC Berkeley in the 2024/2025 academic year.  

My research interests include public finance, development, and their intersection with labor economics. I'm particularly interested in how different tax policies affect inequality. 

I'm currently working as an advisor to the international taxation agenda of the G20 Presidency at the Federal Ministry of Finance in Brazil.
